### Calculator (2025)

This Processing program, created by Xavier Dew on September 25, 2025, is a fully functional graphical calculator designed with an interactive and user-friendly interface. It features a clean layout with buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and several advanced mathematical functions. The program uses arrays to organize numeric and functional buttons, making it easier to manage their display and interactivity within the sketch window.
The calculator supports standard operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as special functions like square root, power, pi, and percentage. It also includes utility controls like clear (C), sign toggle (±), and decimal point (.), along with a display panel that shows the current input or computed result. Each button visually responds when hovered over or clicked, providing clear feedback to the user during operation.
Behind the scenes, the program uses variables to track the left operand, right operand, selected operator, and resulting value. Mouse events determine when a button is pressed, updating the display and performing calculations as needed. The code also includes a modular structure with functions like updateDisplay() and performCalculation() to keep logic and rendering separate. Overall, this project demonstrates effective use of Processing’s graphics and event-handling features to create an engaging and interactive calculator application.
